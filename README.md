# Retro Text Editor

It is a simple text file editor for Android. You can use it via a file manager app. I use it to write some notes. The fixed default file path is `Documents/click.dummer.textthing/notes.txt` . If you open the app, this file will be opened, created and used for store.

**There is no file manager integrated!**
